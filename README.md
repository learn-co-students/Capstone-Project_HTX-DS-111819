## The Requirements

The goal of the Capstone Project is to provide an opportunity for you to demonstrate your accomplishments and to prove you can design, execute, and present a full-scale data science project. 

At the end, your deliverables will at the very least include:

- a GitHub repository contain all code necessary to reproduce this project
- presentation materials for the Project Showcase
- a 3-7 minute video of you delivering a non-technical version of your presentation

A full list of expectations can be found in the rubric which will be used to give feedback on your Capstone Project, linked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9qoZ3hngDgg0jc4wqnXOpSvXzkawWbY9E2AkuzlRB4/edit?usp=sharing) and uploaded in this repository as a PDF.

## The Timeline

Deadlines are denoted in **bold**, the rest are strong suggestions to help keep you on track.

- February 19: If you have multiple ideas and are looking for instructor feedback, you should pitch 3 thought-out ideas to Bryan by the first Wednesday of the capstone module
- **February 21:** You _must_ have Bryan approve your full project design by Friday, February 21

  - We suggest that, by this point, you have gathered all the data you'll be using (if relevant)

- February 28: We suggest that you finish any modeling and evaluation by the end of week 2, allowing plenty of time for you to work on your presentation and to clean up your code and GitHub
- **March 4, 12pm:** **_All modeling, presentation preparation, and deployment should be completed by NOON on Wednesday, March 4!_** This allows the instructors time to give feedback, with a focus on presentation feedback, on your Capstone Projects before graduation
- March 5, 12pm: Video should be complete and uploaded, so all of the videos can be prepared for the Project Showcase
- **March 5, 4:30-7pm:** **PROJECT SHOWCASE** Let's get this place packed with supporters, curious onlookers, and (most importantly) potential employers. Bring your A-Game. You got this.

## Preparation Questions

Things to ask yourself before you start, to prepare!

#### Business Understanding:

- What questions are you asking/problems are you solving?
- What is the industry or realm where this applies?
- Who would be your target audience?
- What pre-existing research or papers in this field can you reference?
- What terms or concepts will you need to research for this field?
- What personal connection do you have to this topic?
- What impact would your answer/solution have on the real world if your analysis were put into production?

#### Data:

- What data are you using? Do you have a pre-made dataset? Or will you have to scrape/use an API?
- If you plan on scraping or using an API, where from/which one?
- What’s your data collection plan? How many days?
- What format will your raw data be in?
- What will you need to clean/merge/wrangle?
- How large will your dataset be?

#### Tools:

- What libraries will you need in order to gather, clean, explore, and model your data?
- Where will you be performing your analysis? On your machine? In the cloud?
 
#### Methodologies:

- What type of problem is this? Classification? Regression? Unsupervised? Supervised?
- What modeling algorithms do you plan to use?
- If you answered “neural networks”, what are two other algorithms you could also use?

## Suggestions

- Avoid 'magical thinking' about data availability, and/or partnering with businesses that promise data but fail to deliver. Partnering with a business can be a great opportunity, but it can be a roadblock to your success as well. If you know the data is ready and available from these people, then by all means carry on! But I would not do this if you haven’t already developed a relationship with this business and trust them to deliver.
- Be wary of supervised learning projects with no labeled data and no way to label data. Make sure your data is actually what you need to answer your questions or tackle your project.
- Avoid EDA projects with no business understanding - make sure you understand what you’re looking at and the scope and frame of your problem. Pick something you will be able to make interpretations about.
- **Begin data collection ASAP!!!**
- Create and evaluate the simplest model first, then if you need to apply a complex model beyond that, do so. However, jumping to the most complex model first makes it hard to justify WHY you would implement that over other simpler models.
- While this is a 3-week project, **this is really more of a 1-week project** with room for data collection and cleaning and assembling your final product and deliverables

Ask for help often! Fail quickly! And, again - YOU GOT THIS.
