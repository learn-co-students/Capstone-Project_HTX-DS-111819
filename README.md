The goal of the Capstone Project is to provide an opportunity for you to demonstrate your accomplishments and to prove you can design, execute, and present a full-scale data science project. 

## The Requirements:

You are expected to spend the Capstone Project module completing a full data science project. 

At the end, your deliverables will at the very least include:

- a GitHub repository contain all code necessary to reproduce this project
- presentation materials for the Project Showcase
- a 3-7 minute video of you delivering a non-technical version of your presentation

A full list of expectations can be found in the rubric which will be used to give feedback on your Capstone Project, linked [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u9qoZ3hngDgg0jc4wqnXOpSvXzkawWbY9E2AkuzlRB4/edit?usp=sharing) and uploaded in this repository as a PDF.

## The Timeline

Deadlines are denoted in **bold**, the rest are strong suggestions to help keep you on track.

- February 19: If you have multiple ideas and are looking for instructor feedback, you should pitch 3 thought-out ideas to Bryan by the first Wednesday of the capstone module
- **February 21:** You _must_ have Bryan approve your full project design by Friday, February 21

  - We suggest that, by this point, you have gathered all the data you'll be using (if relevant)

- February 28: We suggest that you finish any modeling and evaluation by the end of week 2, allowing plenty of time for you to work on your presentation and to clean up your code and GitHub
- **March 4, 12pm:** **_All modeling, presentation preparation, and deployment should be completed by NOON on Wednesday, March 4!_** This allows the instructors time to give feedback, with a focus on presentation feedback, on your Capstone Projects before graduation
- March 5, 12pm: Video should be complete and uploaded, so all of the videos can be prepared for the Project Showcase
- **March 5, 4:30-7pm:** **PROJECT SHOWCASE** Let's get this place packed with supporters, curious onlookers, and (most importantly) potential employers. Bring your A-Game. You got this.
